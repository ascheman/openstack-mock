= OpenStack Mock Service
:toc: left

:icons: font

This repository provides a small HTTP mock service to emulate selected OpenStack endpoints/behaviors for local development and testing.
It uses existing https://kops.sigs.k8s.io[kOps] OpenStack test mock functions.
The code is mostly glue code to expose these functions as a simple HTTP service.

== Prerequisites

* Go 1.25+ (as specified in xref:go.mod[])
* Make (optional but recommended)

== Build

Using Make (recommended):

----
make deps
make build
----

The build creates the binary at:

* bin/openstack-mock

Directly with Go (without Make):

----
go mod tidy
go build -o bin/openstack-mock .
----

== Run

Using Make:

----
make run
----

Directly:

----
./bin/openstack-mock
----

The service listens on 127.0.0.1:19090 by default.
You can change the bind address and port via flags:

`-listen`:: (default: `127.0.0.1`)
`-port`:: (default: `19090`)

Example:

[src,bash]
----
./bin/openstack-mock -listen 0.0.0.0 -port 19091
----

== Quick test

This repository provides a simple HTTP request collection in openstack.http (compatible with IntelliJ / GoLand / HTTP Client; standalone CLI: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/http-client-cli.html[JetBrains HTTP Client CLI]).
You can use it to quickly test endpoints once the server is running.

== Development hints

* Format, vet, and test:
+
----
make fmt
make vet
make test
----

* Clean build artifacts:
